QuizSmart is a web-based quiz application I built using Django. It allows users to register, log in, and take quizzes on various topics. The project focuses on providing a clean user experience with easy quiz navigation, a scoring system, and basic user account management.

1) User registration and login system

2) Dashboard for users to view available quizzes

3) Quiz interface with questions, options, and scoring

4) Timer for each quiz (coming soon)

5) Custom admin panel to add or delete quizzes (in progress)
